# GYM-management-system-MERN-stack-
Developed a full-stack Gym Management System as part of my academic project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application helps gym administrators manage memberships, subscriptions, workout routines, and attendance in a user-friendly and secure environment.

üîê Features:

Member and Admin Login with JWT authentication

Subscription Plans and Payment Tracking

Workout Routine Management

Attendance Logging and Filtering

RESTful APIs with secure backend integration

Responsive UI design with React.js and CSS

The project helped me strengthen my knowledge in web development, backend services, database handling, and user interface design. It also taught me how to work in a modular and scalable environment using Git for version control.
